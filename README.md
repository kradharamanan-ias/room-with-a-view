# room-with-a-view

Visualize your calendar in space-time

## Getting started

After you git clone this repo and navigate to its directory:

1. [get nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script)
2. `nvm install node`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run build`
5. `npm start`

## Contributing

All application logic lives in the views directory.  Currently this is a
multi-window app.  I think it probably only needs a single window.

Brenda and Dhaksha:

First, get the app running

Read this soon to be deprecated documentation because I'm too lazy to
find a more evergreen one:  https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/calendar-resource/

Read this current one: https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/reference/

This seems to imply that rooms are stored as resources.  I think from
there we can generate their utilization information for an arbitrary
time horizon.

We also need to integrate the Google authentication api for the app

Yitong and Stephanie:

First, get the app running

Now that you see the blank whiteness in all it's glory, design the
application flow (there's a login page), and then the pages that show up
afterwards.

What does the user see when they first log in?  Do we want a fancy login
page?

What is the user prompted to do once they do log in?  What happens when
they do it?  Are there any transitions you'd like to explore?  Color
spaces?  Mood boards?  That kind of thing.

Feel free to expand to your designer-y content.
